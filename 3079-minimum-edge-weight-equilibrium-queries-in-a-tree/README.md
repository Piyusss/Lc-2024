<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-edge-weight-equilibrium-queries-in-a-tree">Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red' alt='Difficulty: Hard' /><hr><p>There is an undirected tree with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.</p>

<p>You are also given a 2D integer array <code>queries</code> of length <code>m</code>, where <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query, find the <strong>minimum number of operations</strong> required to make the weight of every edge on the path from <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Queries are <strong>independent</strong> of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its <strong>initial state</strong> on each new query.</li>
	<li>The path from <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> is a sequence of <strong>distinct</strong> nodes starting with node <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and ending with node <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>an array </em><code>answer</code><em> of length </em><code>m</code><em> where</em> <code>answer[i]</code> <em>is the answer to the</em> <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> <em>query.</em></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 7, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,2],[5,6,2]], queries = [[0,3],[3,6],[2,6],[0,6]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,0,1,3]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the first query, all the edges in the path from 0 to 3 have a weight of 1. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the second query, all the edges in the path from 3 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the third query, we change the weight of edge [2,3] to 2. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 2 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,1], [1,2] and [2,3] to 2. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from a<sub>i</sub> to b<sub>i</sub>.

<strong>Input:</strong> n = 8, edges = [[1,2,6],[1,3,4],[2,4,6],[2,5,3],[3,6,6],[3,0,8],[7,0,2]], queries = [[4,6],[0,4],[6,5],[7,4]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,2,3]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the first query, we change the weight of edge [1,3] to 6. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 4 to 6 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the second query, we change the weight of edges [0,3] and [3,1] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the third query, we change the weight of edges [1,3] and [5,2] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 6 to 5 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,7], [0,3] and [1,3] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 7 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from a<sub>i</sub> to b<sub>i</sub>.
